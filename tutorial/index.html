  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This tutorial aims to show you how to inject resources into Akka actors
    using Spring Framework . You will be guided through the different parts used to
    integrate Akka with  Spring and also create a test wrapper for a service
    and rewire the service used during testing without any code changes needed
    to the actor or the application classes.
  </p>

  <h2>Application Overview</h2>

  <p>The application basically consist of two actors defined in the
    <a href="#src/main/scala/sample/actor/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">
    src/main/scala/sample/actor/CountingActor.scala</a> and <a href="#src/main/scala/sample/actor/CountingCoordinatingActor.scala" class="shortcut">
    src/main/scala/sample/actor/CountingCoordinatingActor.scala</a>
    file. This CountingActor actor uses a service defined in the <a href="#src/main/scala/sample/service/CountingService.scala"
    class="shortcut"> CountingService.scala</a> file to increment a
    value. The <code>CountingService</code> is wired into the Actor via  Spring. 
  </p>

  <p>To drive the actor, there is a application defined in the 
    <a href="#src/main/scala/sample/Main.scala" class="shortcut">
    Main.scala</a> file in the <code>main</code> method, that does the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>Initializes Spring</li>
      <li>Creates an actor system</li>
      <li>Sends a couple of messages to the actor so that it uses the
        <code>CountingService</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Running the Application</h2>

  <p>The result of running the <code>Main</code> application is shown in the
    <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "Got back 3" for the
    <a href="#code/app/sample/Main.scala" class="shortcut"> app/sample/Main.scala
    </a> application.
  </p>

  <h2> Running the Test</h2>

  <p>There is also a Specification test for the <code>CountingActor</code> located in
    the <a href="#code/test/sample/SpringTest.scala" class="shortcut">
    test/sample/SpringTest.scala</a> file. It is structured in the same way as
    the <code>Main</code> application.
  </p>

  <p>The result of running the <code>SpringTest</code> test is shown in the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "passed sample.SpringTest.testSpring".
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Akka Extension</h2>

  <p>To be able to use the Spring application context to let Spring create and 
    wire up our actors, we need to store it away in a place that is easily
    accessible from within the actor system. This is an ideal use case for what
    is called an <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/java/extending-akka.html">
    Akka Extension</a>. An extension can be thought of as a per actor system
    singleton and the one in this tutorial is defined in the <a
    href="#code/app/sample/SpringExtension.scala" class="shortcut">
    app/sample/SpringExtension.scala</a> and  <a
    href="#code/app/sample/SpringExtentionImpl.scala" class="shortcut">
    app/sample/SpringExtentionImpl.scala</a> files.
  </p>

  <p>The extension consist of two parts. The <code>SpringExtension</code> class
    that defines the methods used by Akka to create the extension for an actor
    system, and the <code>SpringExtentionImpl</code> class that defines the methods and
    fields available on the extension.
  </p>

  <p>On this extension, the <code>SpringExtentionImpl</code> class, there are only two
    methods, <code> initialize(implicit applicationContext: ApplicationContext)</code>
    that is used during startup to initialize the extension with the right
    Spring application context, and <code>props(actorBeanName: String): Props</code>
    that constructs a <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC2/scala/actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> from an actor bean name, that is used to create an actor.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>Props</code> creation uses the <code>SpringActorProducer</code>
    that we will talk about next.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Spring Actor Producer</h2>

  <p>To let Spring create the actor from a bean name we need a way to allow the
    Akka <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC2/scala/actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> to delegate actor creation to Spring. This is done in the <a
    href="#code/app/sample/SpringActorProducer.scala" class="shortcut">
    app/sample/SpringActorProducer.scala</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>SpringActorProducer</code> implements the <a
    href="http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/2.2.0-RC1/akka/actor/IndirectActorProducer.html">
    <code>IndirectActorProducer</code></a> trait which is a way to let the
    actor be <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC2/scala/actors.html#Creating_Actors_with_Factory_Methods">
    created via a factory method</a>. This trait has two methods that need
    to be implemented, <code>actorClass</code> that will return the type of the
    actor that will be created, and <code>produce</code> that needs to create
    a new actor instance every time that it is called.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Spring Application Configuration</h2>

  <p>To tie everything together and let the Akka actor system know about the
    Spring application context, we have a Spring configuration defined in the
    <a href="#code/app/sample/AppConfiguration.scala" class="shortcut">
    app/sample/AppConfiguration.scala</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>AppConfiguration</code> has three methods the most important is <code>actorSystem
    </code> that is responsible for creating the ActorSystem singleton in this
    Spring application. The code creates the actor system and then initializes
    the <code>SpringExtension</code> with the Spring application context needed
    by the <code>SpringActorProducer</code> to create actor instances from bean
    names.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Creating a Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Since we want to be able to test our actor thoroughly, let's move to our test
    counting service <a href="#code/test/sample/TestCountingService.scala" class="shortcut">
    test/sample/TestCountingService.scala</a>. In our tutorial it will just wrap the real counting
    service and do some extra book keeping, but it could just as easily be a
    complete mock of the service.
  </p>
 
</div>
<div>
  <h2>A Closer Look at the Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Lets take a closer look at the newly created test counting service in the
    file <a href="#code/test/sample/TestCountingService.scala" class="shortcut">
    test/sample/TestCountingService.scala</a>
  </p>

  <p>The class <code>TestCountingService</code> inherits from <code>
    CountingService</code> and overrides the method <code>increment</code> on
    line 8. In that method it keeps track of how many times it has been
    called, by using an internal counter named <code>called</code> and then it
    delegates to the real counting service by calling <code>super.increment(count);</code>
  </p>

  <p>It also has a method named <code>getNumberOfCalls</code> on line 16 that
    returns the value of the internal counter <code>called</code> that can be
    used during testing to verify how the service is being used by the actor.
  </p>

</div>
<div>
  <h2>Wire up the Test Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Now that you have created a test counting service it is time to start using
    it in the test.
  </p>

  <p>Open the <a href="#code/test/sample/SpringTest.scala" class="shortcut">
    test/sample/SpringTest.scala</a> file. At line 32, we used <a href="#code/test/sample/TestAppConfiguration.scala" class="shortcut">
    test/sample/TestAppConfiguration.scala</a> insted of <strong>AppConfiguration</strong>
 

  <p>This will make sure that when we look for a bean named <code>
    CountingService</code> we will instead get the <code>
    TestCountingService</code>.
  </p>

  <p>We would also like to check that the actor actually called the service the
    right number of times by using the <code>getNumberOfCalls</code> method.
     <code> testService.getNumberOfCalls must beEqualTo(3)</code>.
  </p>

  <p> Check that the tests are still green on the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab.
  </p>
